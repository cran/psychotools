Changes in Version 0.1-4

  o Added YouthGratitude data from Froh, Fan, Emmons, Bono, Huebner, Watkins
    (2011, PA), provided by Jeff Froh and Jinyan Fan. Some approximate
    replication code is provided in the examples (the parts depending on
    lavaan are in \dontrun).


Changes in Version 0.1-3

  o Fully exported elementary_symmetric_functions(). (An extended C
    implementation is under development and will be included in
    future releases.)


Changes in Version 0.1-2

  o Support of non-integer weights in btReg.fit(). To facilitate this,
    summary.paircomp() gained a weights argument so that optionally
    the weights are aggregated instead of observations counted.  
  
  o Actually pass on nlm() arguments from RaschModel.fit(). Also
    support iterlim = 0, i.e., set up model at pre-specified parameters.
  
  o Added StereotypeThreat data from Wicherts, Conor, Hessen (2005, JPSP),
    provided by Jelte M. Wicherts. Replication code is provided in the
    examples (the parts depending on lavaan are in \dontrun).


Changes in Version 0.1-1

  o New "psychotools" package containing all 'base' infrastructure
    previously contained in "psychotree". This is in order to provide
    both methods and data that can be reused by "psychotree" and
    the new package "psychomix" (as well as potentially further packages).
    
  o Classes: "paircomp" and associated methods.
  
  o Models: btReg.fit() and RaschModel.fit() and associated methods.
  
  o Data: Firstnames, GermanParties2009, Soundquality (previoulsy in
    psychotree) and VerbalAggression (new data, contained in other
    formatting in difR/verbal and lme4/VerbAgg).
